# Calendar Application

This calendar application offers a user-friendly interface with customizable features to enhance event management and visualization. Here's a breakdown of its key functionalities:



# Event Visualization and Customization:
1  Color-Coded Events: Users can easily distinguish between their selected events as they are highlighted with customized colors for seamless identification.

2  Handling All-Day Events: The calendar efficiently handles all-day events while distinguishing between private and public events. Private event titles remain hidden, displaying a static title like "Busy" for privacy.

3  Distinct Color Coding: Different types of events are visually differentiated with unique color codes. Whether it's a normal event, stretching session, or an all-day event, each type is represented distinctly for clarity.
